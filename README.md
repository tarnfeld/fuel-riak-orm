#Riak ORM for FuelPHP
_This is the develop branch, i'm actively working on it (mainly as I integrate it)._

##Getting started
_As a side note, file paths are relative to the root of this project, *not* fuel-php._

1. Firstly, copy over `./config/riak.php` info your fuel config directory and make the nessassary adjustment for your riak setup.
2. If you want to get started straight away, you can go ahead and run the test by executing `oil test` from the root of your fuel project, you may have to run this via `php oil test` if you don't have oil setup as an executable.
3. Take a look at the test code in `./tests/object.php` to get an idea of how objects work, then start creating your own!
