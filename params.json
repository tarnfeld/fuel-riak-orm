Firstly, copy over `./config/riak.php` info your fuel config directory and make the nessassary adjustment for your riak setup.\r\n2. If you want to get started straight away, you can go ahead and run the test by executing `oil test` from the root of your fuel project, you may have to run this via `php oil test` if you don't have oil setup as an executable.\r\n3. Take a look at the test code in `./tests/object.php` to get an idea of how objects work, then start creating your own!\r\n\r\n##Hardcore Forking\r\nPlease feel free to fork or send me feedback via my twitter account [@tarnfeld](http://twitter.com/tarnfeld) or drop me a message on Github. Hopefully this will come in handy for someone other than me! :-)","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
